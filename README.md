Hi There! I'm Morgan, a senior analyst currently working within Google's data science department on behalf of EssenceMediacom.

ABOUT ME
- After teaching myself Python and SQL I transitioned from a media planning role to data analytics.
- My job is a blend of analytics, data engineering and data science.
- Incredibly organized (I have a spreadsheet for EVERYTHING).
